# time-table
This repository has only one purpose. It aims to help a friend of mine to more easily gather times her students are available to plan the next semester for her flute lessons.

Most of the code was just quickly generated with Claude 3.5 Sonet.

The technical goal of this project was to build a small interface that allows students to enter their available times in a 15-minute-interval time table.
